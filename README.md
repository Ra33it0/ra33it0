### Hi I'm Rabbit 🐇

I like to ab(use) technology for fun and profit.

I am an entrepreneur who likes to strengthen the power of individuals via open source software.

Currently, I'm deep in the NixOS rabbit hole, happily lost and not looking for a way out!

Over the past few years, I have dedicated my time to the world of information security, blockchain and sustainability.
I developed tools and platforms for the Polkadot blockchain including a solution for on chain audits, as well as doing OSINT analysis and a some Nix-based infrastructure projects in the real estate industry.

My interests are privacy preserving technologies and antifragile systems.
