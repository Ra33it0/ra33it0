### Hi I'm Rabbit 🐇
I like to (ab)use technology for fun and profit.

As a developer and entrepreneur, I’m passionate about strengthening individual agency through open-source software.

Currently, I'm deep in the NixOS rabbit hole, happily lost and not looking for a way out!

In recent years, I’ve worked at the intersection of information security, infrastructure, and sustainability. My journey includes:
- Building Nix-based infrastructure projects for the real estate sector.

- Developing [infrastructure](https://github.com/sporyon/dotnix-core) to enhance security in distributed systems.

- Organizing [NixCon 2024](https://2024.nixcon.org/)


My key interests lie in privacy-preserving technologies, Nix and distributed systems.
